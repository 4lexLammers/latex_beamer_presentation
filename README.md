# Plain LaTeX Beamer Template

## About
This repository provides a beamer template with working bibliography using the flexible package [natbib](https://ctan.org/pkg/natbib?lang=de).
The default aspect ratio is 16:9, however, this can easily be changed e.g. to 4:3 within the `header.tex` file.

## Installation
Just download or fork this repository to use the template. To cite the references, just copy the bibtex code in the file `references.bib`.
